                            <p>A Host-Only Network in Docker is a way for containers to talk to each
other and the host machine. But they can’t reach outside networks. This
gives a safe space for development and testing. Containers can work
together and with the host, but they stay away from the outside
world.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at what a Host-Only Network in Docker
is. We will see how it works and when to use it. We will also show steps
to create and connect containers to a Host-Only Network. We will give a
code example to show how to set up a Host-Only Network and how to
configure it. Here are the topics we will cover:</p>

<h2 id="how-does-the-host-only-network-work-in-docker">How Does the
Host-Only Network Work in Docker?</h2>
<p>A Host-Only Network in Docker helps containers talk to each other and
the host. But it keeps them separate from outside networks. We mainly
use this type of network for development and testing. Here, we do not
need access to the outside network.</p>
<p>When we create a Host-Only Network, Docker gives a special range of
IP addresses for the containers. Each container in this network can talk
to the host system using this range without outside problems. Here is
how it works:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Network Creation</strong>: We create a Host-Only Network
using the Docker CLI. We use the <code>docker network create</code>
command and add the <code>--driver</code> option as
<code>bridge</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IP Addressing</strong>: Docker gives an IP address from
the set range to each container that joins the Host-Only Network. The
containers can talk to each other using these IP addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolation</strong>: The Host-Only Network stops access to
outside networks. This means containers can only send and receive
information to and from the host and other containers in the same
network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Routing</strong>: Docker uses a virtual bridge to send
traffic between the containers and the host.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of how to create a Host-Only Network:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network create <span class="at">--driver</span> bridge my_host_only_network</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To check the network settings, we can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network inspect my_host_only_network</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, <code>my_host_only_network</code> is the name of the
Host-Only Network. We can use Docker CLI commands to manage the network.
This way, we can easily communicate between containers while keeping
them separate from the outside network.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-use-cases-for-host-only-networking-in-docker">What
are the Use Cases for Host-Only Networking in Docker?</h2>
<p>Host-only networking in Docker helps when containers need to talk to
each other and the host machine. This happens without exposing services
to the outside network. Here are some important use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Development and Testing</strong>: We can make isolated
spaces for testing applications. This way, we don’t worry about outside
networks messing things up. It is safe to try new things and fix
problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Service Isolation</strong>: We can use host-only networks
to keep services away from the public internet. They can still talk to
the host and other containers. This is good for internal APIs or
microservices.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Database Access</strong>: When we run databases in Docker
containers, host-only networking helps us access the database safely
from application containers. The database stays hidden from the outside
world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Application Staging</strong>: Host-only networks help us
create staging environments. Here, we test applications in conditions
like production. We do this without risking live services.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure Communication</strong>: Some applications need
secure communication between different parts, like message brokers or
backends. A host-only network makes sure that data stays
private.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Management</strong>: When we limit network
access to host-only, we can manage resources better. This reduces
outside traffic, which helps improve performance for communication
between containers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local Development</strong>: We can work on different
services on our own computer. They stay separate from our network, so we
can test how they interact without outside interference.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These use cases show how flexible and secure host-only networks are
in Docker. For more details on Docker networking, you can check out <a

<h2 id="how-to-create-a-host-only-network-in-docker">How to Create a
Host-Only Network in Docker?</h2>
<p>Creating a host-only network in Docker is important when we want
containers to talk to each other. This way, we do not expose them to the
outside world. This network lets containers use the host’s network
without outside access.</p>
<p>To make a host-only network in Docker, we can follow these simple
steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Create the Host-Only Network</strong>: We use the
<code>docker network create</code> command. We add the
<code>--driver</code> flag and set it to <code>bridge</code> or
<code>host</code>. The host driver links containers directly to the host
network.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network create <span class="at">--driver</span> bridge my_host_only_network</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify the Network</strong>: We can check the network to
make sure it was made correctly.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network inspect my_host_only_network</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Run Containers on the Network</strong>: When we start our
containers, we need to say the network using the <code>--network</code>
option.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> container1 <span class="at">--network</span> my_host_only_network nginx</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> container2 <span class="at">--network</span> my_host_only_network nginx</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Check Connectivity</strong>: We can enter one of the
containers to test if it can connect to another container.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> exec <span class="at">-it</span> container1 ping container2</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, <code>my_host_only_network</code> is the name of the
network we created. The image used for the containers is
<code>nginx</code>. We can change these to whatever network name and
image we want.</p>

<h2 id="code-example-setting-up-a-host-only-network-in-docker">Code
Example: Setting Up a Host-Only Network in Docker</h2>
<p>We want to set up a Host-Only Network in Docker. This means we create
a custom network. This network limits access to the host. It allows
communication only between containers. Let’s go through the steps.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Create a Host-Only Network:</strong></p>
<p>We need to use this command to make a new network in Docker. We use
the <code>--driver</code> option and set it to <code>bridge</code>. This
is good for host-only networking:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network create <span class="at">--driver</span> bridge host_only_network</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify the Network Creation:</strong></p>
<p>To check if the network is created, we can list all Docker
networks:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network ls</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We should see <code>host_only_network</code> in the list.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run Containers on the Host-Only Network:</strong></p>
<p>Now we can run Docker containers that connect to this host-only
network. Here is an example of running two containers:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> container1 <span class="at">--network</span> host_only_network nginx</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> container2 <span class="at">--network</span> host_only_network nginx</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this case, both <code>container1</code> and
<code>container2</code> run the Nginx server. They connect to the
<code>host_only_network</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Test Communication Between Containers:</strong></p>
<p>We need to check if the containers can talk to each other. We can run
a command inside one container and ping the other:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> exec <span class="at">-it</span> container1 ping container2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command pings from <code>container1</code> to
<code>container2</code>. It shows they can communicate over the
host-only network.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inspect the Network:</strong></p>
<p>We can look at the details of the host-only network with this
command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network inspect host_only_network</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command gives us information about the network settings and the
connected containers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, we set up a Host-Only Network in Docker.
This lets containers talk to each other without going to the outside
network. If we want to learn more about how Docker networking works, we

<h2 id="how-to-connect-containers-to-a-host-only-network-in-docker">How
to Connect Containers to a Host-Only Network in Docker?</h2>
<p>To connect containers to a host-only network in Docker, we first need
to create the network. Then we can launch containers that will connect
to this network. Let’s follow these simple steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Create a Host-Only Network</strong>:<br />
We use the command below to create a host-only network. We must specify
the network driver as <code>bridge</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network create <span class="at">--driver</span> bridge host_only_network</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Run Containers on the Host-Only Network</strong>:<br />
When we start a container, we use the <code>--network</code> flag to
connect it to the host-only network we just made.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> container1 <span class="at">--network</span> host_only_network nginx</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> container2 <span class="at">--network</span> host_only_network httpd</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Verify Network Connection</strong>:<br />
We can check if our containers are connected to the host-only network by
inspecting the network.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network inspect host_only_network</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will show details about the connected containers and their IP
addresses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communication Between Containers</strong>:<br />
Containers on the same host-only network can talk to each other using
their names or IP addresses.</p>
<p>For example, to ping <code>container1</code> from
<code>container2</code>, we can use this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> exec <span class="at">-it</span> container2 ping container1</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Docker Compose</strong>:<br />
We can also use Docker Compose to easily set up and connect containers
to a host-only network. Here is a simple <code>docker-compose.yml</code>
file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16"><pre
class="sourceCode yaml"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb16-1"><a href="#cb16-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">version</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="st">&#39;3&#39;</span></span>

<p>We can deploy the application with this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre

</ol>
<p>This process helps us connect and manage containers in a host-only
network in Docker. It also allows for secure and isolated communication.

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-a-host-only-network-in-docker">What is a host-only
network in Docker?</h3>
<p>A host-only network in Docker is a way for containers to talk to each
other and the host machine. They do this without using the internet.
This is good for when we want to keep things separate from the web. It
helps us stay safe and makes local development easier. Containers can
share things but stay hidden from outside networks. This is a smart
choice for testing and developing.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-create-a-host-only-network-in-docker">How do I create a
host-only network in Docker?</h3>
<p>Creating a host-only network in Docker is easy. We can use the Docker
CLI command to make a network that does not connect to the internet. The
command looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb18"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb18-1"><a href="#cb18-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network create <span class="at">--driver</span> bridge my-host-only-network</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command makes a bridge network called
<code>my-host-only-network</code>. It lets containers on the same host
talk to each other without internet.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-connect-existing-containers-to-a-host-only-network">Can I
connect existing containers to a host-only network?</h3>
<p>Yes, we can connect existing containers to a host-only network in
Docker. To connect a running container to our host-only network, we use
this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network connect my-host-only-network container_name</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Just change <code>container_name</code> to the name of your
container. This lets that container talk to others in the same host-only
network.</p>
<h3
id="what-are-the-limitations-of-using-host-only-networks-in-docker">What
are the limitations of using host-only networks in Docker?</h3>
<p>Host-only networks in Docker have some limits. Containers in this
network can’t talk to outside networks. This can stop them from reaching
web resources. Also, if the host machine shuts down or restarts, all the
network settings will disappear. So, we need to think about these things
when we choose to use a host-only network for development or
testing.</p>
<h3
id="how-does-a-host-only-network-differ-from-other-docker-networks">How
does a host-only network differ from other Docker networks?</h3>
<p>A host-only network is different from other Docker networks like
bridge or overlay networks. It has a different purpose and access.
Bridge networks let containers talk to each other and connect to
external networks. But host-only networks only let connections between
the host and containers in the same network. This keeps things secure
but limits the ability to connect with outside systems or services.</p>
