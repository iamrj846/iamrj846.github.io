                            <p>A Docker container is a simple unit of software. It packs code and
everything it needs so the application can run fast and steady in
different computing places. Unlike regular virtual machines that make
virtual hardware, Docker containers use the host system’s operating
system. They run separate processes in user space. This main difference
makes Docker containers lighter and more efficient than virtual
machines.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at what a Docker container is. We will

<h2 id="how-does-a-docker-container-work">How Does a Docker Container
Work?</h2>
<p>We can say that a Docker container works by using the operating
system’s kernel. It uses containerization technology to create an
environment for applications. Containers share the host OS kernel. This
makes them light and fast when we compare them to traditional virtual
machines. Virtual machines need their own operating system.</p>
<h3 id="key-functionalities">Key Functionalities</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: Each Docker container runs in its own
space. This means applications do not mess with each other.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Management</strong>: Docker uses control groups or
cgroups. This helps limit and manage the resources like CPU and memory
that containers use.</li>
<li><strong>Filesystem</strong>: Containers have a layered filesystem.
This is built on a base image. When we make changes in a container, it
creates a new layer. The original image stays unchanged.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="working-mechanism">Working Mechanism</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Images</strong>: We create Docker containers from Docker
images. These images are read-only templates. They have the
application’s code and what it needs to run.</p>
<p>Example to pull an image:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> pull nginx</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Container Creation</strong>: When we create a container,
it adds a writable layer on top of the image. This allows us to change
the container without changing the original image.</p>
<p>Example to create and run a container:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> mynginx <span class="at">-p</span> 80:80 nginx</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Networking</strong>: Docker has its own way of
networking. This helps containers talk to each other and also to the
outside world through virtual networks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Volumes</strong>: We manage data storage with volumes.
These can be shared between containers and they stay around even if we
remove the container.</p>
<p>Example to create a volume:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> volume create mydata</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Commands</strong>: Docker has a command line interface.
This helps us manage containers. We can start, stop, and check them.</p>
<p>Example to stop a running container:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> stop mynginx</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ul>
<p>By using these parts and functions, Docker containers give us a
flexible and fast way to run applications in a consistent way across
different setups. For more details on how Docker containers are
different from virtual machines, you can check <a

article</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-advantages-of-using-docker-containers">What are the
Advantages of Using Docker Containers?</h2>
<p>Docker containers have many good points compared to regular
virtualization methods. This is why developers and system admins like
them a lot. Here are some key benefits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Lightweight</strong>: Docker containers use the host OS
kernel. This makes them lighter than virtual machines (VMs). So, they
start faster and use less resources.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolation</strong>: Each container runs in its own space.
This means applications do not bother each other. This helps with
security and stability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Portability</strong>: Docker containers work the same in
different places. They can run on local machines or production servers.
This makes deployment easier and solves the “it works on my machine”
problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability</strong>: We can easily scale containers up
or down. This helps us manage resources better. With tools like
Kubernetes, we can handle many containers automatically.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simplified DevOps</strong>: Docker makes the development
process smoother. Developers can create, test, and deploy apps in the
same environment. This speeds up the development cycle.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rapid Deployment</strong>: We can deploy containers fast.
This helps with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). So, we can
release new features and fix bugs quicker.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Version Control</strong>: Docker images can have
versions. This allows easy rollback to earlier versions if we need to.
It is very important for keeping stability in production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Efficiency</strong>: Containers share the host
OS and run alone. This usually means they need less resources than
running many VMs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ecosystem and Community</strong>: Docker has a big
ecosystem with a lot of tools and resources. Docker Hub is a place where
we can share and manage container images.</p></li>

<h2 id="what-are-the-key-components-of-a-docker-container">What are the
Key Components of a Docker Container?</h2>
<p>Docker containers are small, stand-alone packages. They have
everything we need to run software. This includes the code, the runtime,
libraries, and tools. The main parts of a Docker container are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Docker Image</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a template that we use to create containers. It is
read-only. It has the application code and all the things it needs to
run.</li>
<li>We build images with a <code>Dockerfile</code>. This file has
instructions on how to put the image together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a simple Dockerfile example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode dockerfile"><code class="sourceCode dockerfile"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">FROM</span> python:3.9-slim</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">WORKDIR</span> /app</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">COPY</span> . /app</span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">RUN</span> <span class="ex">pip</span> install <span class="at">-r</span> requirements.txt</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">CMD</span> [<span class="st">&quot;python&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;app.py&quot;</span>]</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Container Runtime</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is the place where the container runs. Docker Engine is the
most common runtime. It helps us create, manage, and run
containers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Container Storage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each container has its own file system. This comes from the image.
When we change things in the container, these changes are saved in a
writable layer on top of the read-only image layers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Networking</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker containers can talk to each other and the outside world. They
do this through networking. By default, Docker uses bridge networks. It
also supports different types of networks like host and overlay
networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Volumes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>These are for saving data that we want to keep even after the
container stops. Volumes let data stay beyond the container’s life. We
can also share volumes between containers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of creating a volume:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> volume create my_volume</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">-v</span> my_volume:/data my_image</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p><strong>Container Metadata</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is information about the container. It includes its ID, state,
and setup. Docker manages this data. We can see it by using commands
like <code>docker inspect</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Docker Hub</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a cloud service for sharing Docker images. We can pull
images from Docker Hub. We can also push our own images to share with
others.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

is a Docker image and how is it different from a container</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-create-and-run-a-docker-container">How to Create and Run
a Docker Container?</h2>
<p>Creating and running a Docker container is simple. We need to follow
some steps, starting from installing Docker to running our first
container. Here are the key commands and settings we need to begin.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-install-docker">Step 1: Install Docker</h3>
<p>First, we must make sure Docker is on our machine. We can follow the
installation guide for our operating system from the <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-install-docker-on-different-operating-systems.html">Docker
installation documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="step-2-pull-an-image">Step 2: Pull an Image</h3>
<p>Next, we need a Docker image before we can run a container. We can
use this command to pull an official image from Docker Hub, like the
Ubuntu image:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> pull ubuntu</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="step-3-create-and-run-a-docker-container">Step 3: Create and Run
a Docker Container</h3>
<p>We can create and run a Docker container using the
<code>docker run</code> command. This command will start a container
from the Ubuntu image and open a terminal session:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-it</span> ubuntu</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>-i</code>: This keeps STDIN open even if we do not attach
it.</li>
<li><code>-t</code>: This gives us a pseudo-TTY.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-4-running-a-command-in-a-container">Step 4: Running a
Command in a Container</h3>
<p>If we want to run a specific command in a container, we can add the
command at the end of the <code>docker run</code> command. For example,
to run a bash shell in an Ubuntu container, we use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-it</span> ubuntu bash</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="step-5-list-running-containers">Step 5: List Running
Containers</h3>
<p>To see all running containers, we can use this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> ps</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="step-6-stop-a-container">Step 6: Stop a Container</h3>
<p>If we need to stop a running container, we use this command. We
should replace <code>&lt;container_id&gt;</code> with the real ID of the
container:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> stop <span class="op">&lt;</span>container_id<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="step-7-remove-a-container">Step 7: Remove a Container</h3>
<p>To remove a stopped container, we run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> rm <span class="op">&lt;</span>container_id<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="example-creating-a-simple-web-server">Example: Creating a Simple
Web Server</h3>
<p>Here is an example of running a simple Nginx web server in a Docker
container:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">-p</span> 80:80 nginx</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>-d</code>: This runs the container in detached mode.</li>
<li><code>-p</code>: This maps port 80 on our host to port 80 on the
container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inspecting-container-logs">Inspecting Container Logs</h3>
<p>To check the logs of a running container, we can use this
command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> logs <span class="op">&lt;</span>container_id<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>These commands help us understand how to create and run a Docker
container easily. For more advanced uses and Docker ideas, we can check

<h2
id="what-are-the-limitations-of-docker-containers-compared-to-virtual-machines">What
are the Limitations of Docker Containers Compared to Virtual
Machines?</h2>
<p>We know that Docker containers are efficient and lightweight. But
they have some limits when we compare them to traditional virtual
machines (VMs). These limits come from how they are built and how they
work with the host operating system. Here are the main limits of Docker
containers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Isolation Level</strong>: Docker containers share the
host OS kernel. This can give us less isolation than VMs, which run on
hypervisors with separate kernels. Because of this, there can be
security risks if a container takes advantage of the host
kernel.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Operating System Constraints</strong>: Docker containers
can only run on the same OS family as the host. For example, we cannot
run a Windows container on a Linux host or the other way around. But VMs
can run different operating systems independently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Resource Management</strong>: Docker lets us set some
limits on resources like CPU and memory. But VMs have better resource
isolation and management. They can give dedicated resources, which helps
reduce competition between applications.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Persistent Storage</strong>: Docker containers lose data
when they stop. They are temporary by nature. We can use Docker volumes
for persistent storage. But managing data across many containers can be
harder than using VM snapshots and disk images.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Networking Complexity</strong>: Docker has a layered
networking model. This can make networking setups harder, especially for
applications that need complex networking. VMs usually have simpler
networking options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Performance Overhead</strong>: Even if containers are
lighter than VMs, they can still add some overhead. This happens because
of shared resources, especially when the host resources are under a lot
of load.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Compatibility with Legacy Applications</strong>: Some old
applications need a full OS environment to work well. In this case, VMs
are a better choice than Docker containers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tooling and Ecosystem</strong>: The Docker ecosystem is
growing. But some big companies still use traditional VM management
tools that do not fully work with container management tools.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In short, Docker containers have many benefits like speed and
resource efficiency. But their limits with isolation, OS compatibility,
and persistent storage can make VMs a better choice in some situations.

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3
id="what-is-the-main-difference-between-a-docker-container-and-a-virtual-machine">1.
What is the main difference between a Docker container and a virtual
machine?</h3>
<p>The main difference between a Docker container and a virtual machine
is how they are built. Docker containers use the host operating system’s
kernel. This makes them lightweight and fast. On the other hand, virtual
machines run a full guest OS on a hypervisor. This uses more resources.
Docker containers are great for microservices and quick deployment.
Virtual machines work better for apps that need a complete OS. To learn
more about this, click <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-does-docker-differ-from-virtual-machines.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-docker-containers-work-in-terms-of-isolation">2. How do
Docker containers work in terms of isolation?</h3>
<p>Docker containers keep processes separate by using namespaces and
control groups from the host OS. This setup makes sure each container
works in its own space and has limited access to the host’s resources.
Unlike virtual machines that imitate full hardware, Docker containers
work at the application layer. This makes them better for running many
apps at the same time. For more info, check how Docker works <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-is-a-docker-container-and-how-does-it-operate.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-main-parts-of-a-docker-container">3. What are the
main parts of a Docker container?</h3>
<p>A Docker container has several important parts. Docker images are the
blueprints for containers. The Docker Engine is what runs and manages
containers. The Dockerfile explains how to build a Docker image. Docker
Hub is where we can share and store images. Knowing these parts is key
to using Docker containers well. You can learn more about Docker parts
<a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-the-core-components-of-docker-architecture.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="can-docker-containers-run-on-any-operating-system">4. Can Docker
containers run on any operating system?</h3>
<p>Docker containers can run on any operating system that supports the
Docker Engine. This includes popular OS like Linux, Windows, and macOS.
But, we need to remember that Linux containers usually run best on Linux
hosts. Windows containers need a Windows host. This ability to work on
different systems makes Docker a flexible tool for developers. To learn
how to install Docker on different OS, visit <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-install-docker-on-different-operating-systems.html">this
article</a>.</p>
<h3
id="what-are-the-limits-of-docker-containers-compared-to-virtual-machines">5.
What are the limits of Docker containers compared to virtual
machines?</h3>
<p>Docker containers are good for saving resources and quick deployment.
But they have limits when we compare them to virtual machines.
Containers share the host OS kernel. This can cause security issues if
one container gets hacked. Also, Docker containers might not fully copy
a complete OS environment. This can be needed for some apps. Knowing
these limits helps us pick the right tool for our needs. For more
details, see our comparison <a
