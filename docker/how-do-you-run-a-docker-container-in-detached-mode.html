                            <p>Running a Docker container in detached mode helps the container to
work in the background. This way, we can keep using the command line or
terminal for other tasks. Detached mode is very useful for processes
that take a long time. It lets us use the terminal for other things and
makes it easier to manage many containers.</p>
<p>In this article, we will talk about how to run a Docker container in
detached mode. We will explain what it is, its benefits, and give easy

<h2 id="what-is-detached-mode-in-docker">What is Detached Mode in
Docker?</h2>
<p>Detached mode in Docker means a container runs in the background.
This lets it work on its own, separate from the terminal that started
it. When we run a container in detached mode, it does not block the
command line. We can still use the terminal for other tasks.</p>
<p>In detached mode, the container’s output does not show in the
terminal. This makes it good for long-running processes or services that
do not need immediate attention. It is very useful for things like web
servers, databases, or any service that should always run in the
background.</p>
<p>To start a Docker container in detached mode, we use the
<code>-d</code> flag in the <code>docker run</code> command. For
example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> my-nginx nginx</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, we start an Nginx container called
<code>my-nginx</code> in detached mode. The container runs in the
background. The command prompt comes back right away. This means we can
run more commands.</p>
<p>Detached mode is important for managing production environments.
Here, uptime and resource management are very important. It helps us
deploy applications without being connected to a terminal session. For
more details about Docker, we can check <a

<h2 id="why-use-detached-mode-for-docker-containers">Why Use Detached
Mode for Docker Containers?</h2>
<p>We can use detached mode in Docker to let containers run in the
background. They work separately from the terminal that started them.
This mode is helpful in many cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Resource Management</strong>: When we run containers in
detached mode, we save terminal resources. This lets us use the terminal
for other tasks while the container runs by itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Long-Running Processes</strong>: Detached mode is good
for applications that need to run all the time. This includes web
servers or databases. It makes sure these services keep running, even if
we close the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Workflow</strong>: It helps us have a better
workflow in both development and production. We can start containers
without having to watch them in the terminal.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-Container Applications</strong>: When we have
complex apps with many containers, detached mode makes it easier to
manage them. It lets tools like Docker Compose start services at the
same time without waiting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To start a container in detached mode, we use the <code>-d</code>
flag. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> myContainer nginx</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command runs the NGINX server in the background. We can then use
other commands while the server is running.</p>

<h2
id="how-to-start-a-docker-container-in-detached-mode-with-command-line">How
to Start a Docker Container in Detached Mode with Command Line?</h2>
<p>To start a Docker container in detached mode, we use the
<code>-d</code> flag with the <code>docker run</code> command. This
makes the container run in the background. It lets us use the terminal
for other commands.</p>
<h3 id="basic-syntax">Basic Syntax</h3>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="pp">[</span><span class="ss">OPTIONS</span><span class="pp">]</span> IMAGE <span class="pp">[</span><span class="ss">COMMAND</span><span class="pp">]</span> <span class="pp">[</span><span class="ss">ARG...</span><span class="pp">]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>If we want to run an Nginx container in detached mode, we can run
this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> my-nginx <span class="at">-p</span> 80:80 nginx</span></code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li><code>-d</code>: This runs the container in detached mode.</li>
<li><code>--name my-nginx</code>: This gives a name to the container. It
makes it easier to manage.</li>
<li><code>-p 80:80</code>: This connects port 80 of the host to port 80
of the container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-options">Additional Options</h3>
<p>We can add different options when we start a container in detached
mode: - <code>--restart always</code>: This makes sure the container
restarts automatically if it fails. - <code>-e ENV_VAR=value</code>:
This sets environment variables in the container.</p>
<h3 id="example-with-environment-variable">Example with Environment
Variable</h3>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span> my-app <span class="at">-e</span> ENV=prod my-app-image</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command starts a container from <code>my-app-image</code>. The
environment variable <code>ENV</code> is set to <code>prod</code>, and
it runs in detached mode.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-check-running-docker-containers-in-detached-mode">How to
Check Running Docker Containers in Detached Mode?</h2>
<p>To check running Docker containers in detached mode, we can use the
<code>docker ps</code> command. This command shows all active
containers. It helps us see their status and get important details like
container IDs, names, and if they are running.</p>
<h3 id="command-to-check-running-containers">Command to Check Running

<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> ps</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="output-explanation">Output Explanation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>CONTAINER ID</strong>: This is a special number for each
container.</li>
<li><strong>IMAGE</strong>: This is the Docker image that made the
container.</li>
<li><strong>COMMAND</strong>: This is the command that ran when the
container started.</li>
<li><strong>CREATED</strong>: This shows when we created the
container.</li>
<li><strong>STATUS</strong>: This tells us the current status of the
container, like if it is running.</li>
<li><strong>PORTS</strong>: This shows the port connections between the
host and the container.</li>
<li><strong>NAMES</strong>: This is the name we gave to the
container.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional-options-1">Additional Options</h3>
<p>If we want to see all containers, even the ones that are not running,
we can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> ps <span class="at">-a</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command will show both running and stopped containers. If we
want more details about a specific container, we can use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> inspect <span class="op">&lt;</span>container_id_or_name<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command gives us detailed information about that container. It

<h2 id="how-to-stop-a-docker-container-running-in-detached-mode">How to
Stop a Docker Container Running in Detached Mode?</h2>
<p>To stop a Docker container that runs in detached mode, we need to use
the <code>docker stop</code> command. We put the container’s name or ID
after this command. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Find the Running Container</strong>: First, we check the
running containers to get the name or ID of the container we want to
stop. We can use this command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> ps</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command shows all running containers with their IDs and
names.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Stop the Container</strong>: After we find the container
ID or name, we can stop it. We do this by running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> stop <span class="op">&lt;</span>container_id_or_name<span class="op">&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We need to replace <code>&lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</code> with the
real ID or name of the container.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check if the Container is Stopped</strong>: To make sure
the container has stopped, we can run the <code>docker ps</code> command
again. The stopped container will not show up in the list of running
containers.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="example-1">Example</h3>
<p>If we have a container called <code>my-app</code> running in detached
mode, we can stop it by using:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> stop my-app</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This command tells Docker to stop the container safely. For more

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-to-run-a-docker-container-in-detached-mode">1.
What does it mean to run a Docker container in detached mode?</h3>
<p>Running a Docker container in detached mode means the container works
in the background. This lets us use our terminal for other commands. It
is important for long processes or services. This way, we can manage our
workflow better. To run a Docker container in detached mode, we use the
<code>-d</code> flag with the <code>docker run</code> command. For
example, we can write
<code>docker run -d [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]</code>.</p>
<h3
id="how-can-i-check-if-my-docker-container-is-running-in-detached-mode">2.
How can I check if my Docker container is running in detached mode?</h3>
<p>To check if our Docker container is running in detached mode, we can
use the command <code>docker ps</code>. This command shows all active
containers and their status. If our container is listed, it is running
in the background. This means it is working as it should. To see more
details about the container’s logs, we can use
<code>docker logs [CONTAINER_ID]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-connect-to-a-docker-container-running-in-detached-mode">3.
Can I connect to a Docker container running in detached mode?</h3>
<p>Yes, we can connect to a Docker container that is running in detached
mode. We do this by using the <code>docker exec</code> command. This
lets us run commands inside the container without stopping it. For
example, we can type
<code>docker exec -it [CONTAINER_ID] /bin/bash</code> to open a shell
inside the container. This is helpful for troubleshooting or managing
tasks inside the container.</p>
<h3
id="how-do-i-stop-a-docker-container-that-is-running-in-detached-mode">4.
How do I stop a Docker container that is running in detached mode?</h3>
<p>To stop a Docker container running in detached mode, we can use the
command <code>docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]</code>. This command stops the
container nicely and lets it finish its tasks. If we need to stop it
quickly, we can use <code>docker kill [CONTAINER_ID]</code>. We should
always stop containers properly to avoid losing data or causing
problems.</p>
<h3
id="are-there-any-best-practices-for-running-docker-containers-in-detached-mode">5.
Are there any best practices for running Docker containers in detached
mode?</h3>
<p>When we run Docker containers in detached mode, it is good to use
proper logging and monitoring to check how the containers are doing.
Also, we should not run many services in one container. This helps us
follow the microservices idea. For more details on best practices in
containerization, we can look at our article on <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-is-containerization-and-how-does-it-relate-to-docker.html">what
is containerization and how does it relate to Docker</a>.</p>
<p>By answering these common questions, we can understand better how to
run Docker containers in detached mode. This will make our Docker
experience better.</p>
