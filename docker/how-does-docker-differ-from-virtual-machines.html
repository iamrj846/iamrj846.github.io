                            <p><strong>Docker vs Virtual Machines: Key Differences</strong></p>
<p>Docker is a platform that helps us automate how we deploy, scale, and
manage applications. It uses something called containerization. This
means we can pack applications and what they need into a standard unit
called a container. On the other hand, virtual machines (VMs) work by
virtualizing whole hardware systems. This lets us run many operating
systems on one physical machine. Because Docker and VMs work so
differently, it changes how we think about performance, using resources,
and design.</p>
<p>In this article, we will look at how Docker is different from virtual
machines in many ways. We will cover technical details, architecture,
resource use, networking, storage management, and performance tests. By
learning these differences, we will understand better the pros and cons
of using Docker containers compared to regular virtual machines. We will
discuss these topics:</p>

<h2
id="architecture-comparison-of-docker-and-virtual-machines">Architecture
Comparison of Docker and Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Docker and virtual machines (VMs) are two different technologies for
virtualization. Each has its own way of working. Knowing how they are
different is important for choosing the right way to deploy your
application.</p>
<h3 id="docker-architecture">Docker Architecture</h3>
<p>Docker uses a container-based architecture. Here are the main
parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker Engine</strong>: This is the part that creates,
manages, and runs containers.</li>
<li><strong>Docker Daemon</strong>: This part listens for requests and
manages Docker containers.</li>
<li><strong>Docker Client</strong>: This is a command-line tool that
talks to the Docker Daemon to manage containers.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong>: These are read-only templates that we use
to create containers. They can be layered and shared through
registries.</li>
<li><strong>Containers</strong>: These are light and isolated spaces
that run applications. They share the host OS kernel but have their own
filesystem, processes, and network.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see the architecture like this:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>+------------------------------------+
|             Host OS                |
| +-------------------------------+  |
| |        Docker Engine         |  |
| | +---------------------------+|  |
| | |        Containers         ||  |
| | +---------------------------+|  |
| +-------------------------------+  |
+------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<h3 id="virtual-machines-architecture">Virtual Machines
Architecture</h3>
<p>Virtual machines use a hypervisor-based architecture. Here are the
main ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hypervisor</strong>: This is a software layer that creates
and manages VMs. It can be type 1 (bare-metal) or type 2 (hosted).</li>
<li><strong>Guest OS</strong>: Each VM runs a complete operating system.
This includes the kernel and application libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Hardware</strong>: Each VM gets a virtual CPU,
memory, storage, and network interfaces to act like real hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see this architecture like this:</p>
<pre class="plaintext"><code>+------------------------------------+
|             Host OS                |
| +-------------------------------+  |
| |         Hypervisor           |  |
| | +---------------------------+|  |
| | |       VM 1               ||  |
| | | +-----------------------+ ||  |
| | | |     Guest OS 1      | ||  |
| | | +-----------------------+ ||  |
| | +---------------------------+|  |
| | +---------------------------+|  |
| | |       VM 2               ||  |
| | | +-----------------------+ ||  |
| | | |     Guest OS 2      | ||  |
| | | +-----------------------+ ||  |
| | +---------------------------+|  |
| +-------------------------------+  |
+------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<h3 id="key-differences-in-architecture">Key Differences in
Architecture</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolation Level</strong>: Docker containers share the host
OS kernel. But VMs run full guest OS instances, which uses more
resources.</li>
<li><strong>Startup Time</strong>: Docker containers usually start in
seconds because they are light. VMs can take minutes to boot since they
load a whole OS.</li>
<li><strong>Resource Overhead</strong>: Docker is better at using
resources. Containers share resources, while VMs need dedicated
resources for each guest OS.</li>
</ul>

Docker?</a>.</p>
<h2 id="resource-utilization-in-docker-and-virtual-machines">Resource
Utilization in Docker and Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>We see that Docker containers use system resources better than
virtual machines (VMs). This is because Docker is lightweight. Here is a
simple comparison of resource use between Docker and VMs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Isolation Level</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: It uses the host OS kernel. This means
containers can share the same OS resources. So, there is less
overhead.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>: Each VM runs a full operating
system and a hypervisor. This uses more resources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Startup Time</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: Containers can start in seconds. They don’t
need to boot an OS.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>: VMs usually take minutes to start
because they boot a full OS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Memory Usage</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: Containers share memory. They can change
memory use based on what the application needs.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>: Each VM has a fixed amount of
RAM. This can lead to wasted memory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>CPU Utilization</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: It uses CPU more efficiently. Multiple
containers can run on the same core without the extra load of different
OS instances.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>: Each VM uses part of the CPU. If
not managed well, some resources may sit idle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Disk Space</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: Images are layered. This means multiple
containers can share the same layers and save disk space.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>: Each VM has its own disk image.
This can take up a lot of space.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-docker-resource-configuration">Example Docker Resource
Configuration</h3>
<p>To limit how much resource Docker uses, we can set options like
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">--memory</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;512m&quot;</span> <span class="at">--cpus</span><span class="op">=</span><span class="st">&quot;1&quot;</span> my_docker_image</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="example-virtual-machine-resource-configuration">Example Virtual
Machine Resource Configuration</h3>
<p>In a VM setup (like using VirtualBox), we might set resources like
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">VBoxManage</span> modifyvm <span class="st">&quot;VM Name&quot;</span> <span class="at">--memory</span> 2048 <span class="at">--cpus</span> 2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In summary, Docker’s way of using resources is more efficient and
gives better performance than traditional Virtual Machines. This is why
many people choose Docker for modern application deployment. For more

<h2
id="networking-differences-between-docker-and-virtual-machines">Networking
Differences Between Docker and Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>Docker and virtual machines (VMs) handle networking in different
ways. This leads to unique features and setups.</p>
<h3 id="networking-model">Networking Model</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: It uses a layered networking model. This
setup lets containers talk to each other and to the outside world. By
default, Docker makes a bridge network for containers.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Machines</strong>: Each VM acts like a full hardware
setup. This includes its own network interface card (NIC). VMs usually
run their own operating systems and can have several virtual NICs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="network-types">Network Types</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Docker Network Types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bridge</strong>: This is the default network for containers.
It lets them talk on the same host.</li>
<li><strong>Host</strong>: This option uses the host’s networking
directly. This gives better performance.</li>
<li><strong>Overlay</strong>: This allows containers to communicate
across different Docker hosts using a virtual network.</li>
<li><strong>Macvlan</strong>: This lets containers have their own MAC
addresses. This way, they can look like physical devices on the
network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>VM Network Types</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NAT</strong>: VMs share the host’s IP address. They get
accessed through port forwarding.</li>
<li><strong>Bridged</strong>: VMs connect to a physical network. They
get an IP from the DHCP server.</li>
<li><strong>Host-only</strong>: VMs can talk to the host and to each
other. But they can’t connect to outside networks.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-example">Configuration Example</h3>
<p>In Docker, we can create a custom bridge network like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> network create my_bridge_network</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To run a container in that network, we use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">--name</span><span class="op">=</span>my_container <span class="at">--network</span><span class="op">=</span>my_bridge_network my_image</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For VMs, we can set up a bridged network often through the
virtualization software. In VMware or VirtualBox, we just pick the
“Bridged” option for the network adapter.</p>
<h3 id="port-mapping">Port Mapping</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: It uses port mapping to show container
ports to the host. For example:</li>
</ul>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-d</span> <span class="at">-p</span> 8080:80 my_image</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This connects port 80 in the container to port 8080 on the host.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VMs</strong>: For these, we set up port forwarding rules in
the hypervisor. This needs extra steps to show services running inside
the VM.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: It usually has less delay and better speed
for container communication. This happens because it is lightweight and
shares the kernel.</li>
<li><strong>VMs</strong>: These add extra weight because they run
separate operating systems. This can slow down performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Docker gives a more flexible and efficient way to handle networking
than traditional virtual machines. This makes it great for microservices
and cloud-native applications. For more about Docker’s setup, check out

<h2 id="storage-management-in-docker-and-virtual-machines">Storage
Management in Docker and Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>We see that storage management in Docker and Virtual Machines (VMs)
is very different because of how they are built and work.</p>
<p>In Virtual Machines, each VM has its own complete operating system
and virtual hardware. This means each one has separate storage. VMs
usually use virtual disk files like VMDK for VMware or VHD for Hyper-V
to manage storage. Here is an example of how to create a virtual disk in
a VM:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Example command for creating a VMDK file in VMware</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">vmware-vdiskmanager</span> <span class="at">-c</span> <span class="at">-s</span> 20GB <span class="at">-a</span> lsilogic <span class="at">-t</span> 0 mydisk.vmdk</span></code></pre></div>
<p>On the other hand, Docker uses a layered filesystem. It shares the
host kernel, which helps with better storage management. Docker
containers work with images that have layers. Each layer shows a change
or addition to the base image. We store Docker images in a registry and
can pull them when we need. Here is an example of managing storage in
Docker:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Pulling an image from Docker Hub</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> pull ubuntu</span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><a href="#cb9-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Listing all images</span></span>
<span id="cb9-5"><a href="#cb9-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> images</span>
<span id="cb9-6"><a href="#cb9-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb9-7"><a href="#cb9-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Running a container with volume mapping</span></span>
<span id="cb9-8"><a href="#cb9-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-v</span> /host/path:/container/path ubuntu</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Docker also lets us manage storage with volumes and bind mounts. We
manage volumes with Docker, and we can share them among containers. Bind
mounts let us specify an exact path on the host. Here is how we create a
volume:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre
class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Creating a Docker volume</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> volume create my_volume</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># Running a container with the created volume</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><a href="#cb10-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ex">docker</span> run <span class="at">-v</span> my_volume:/data ubuntu</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When we look at performance, Docker’s storage management is lighter
and faster to use than VMs. This is because there is no separate OS
overhead. But VMs give us better isolation and can run different
operating systems. This can be important for some applications.</p>

Benchmarks of Docker and Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>When we look at the performance of Docker and Virtual Machines (VMs),
we see many tests show that containers are faster and more efficient
than traditional VMs. Docker containers use the host’s OS kernel. This
means they have less overhead. On the other hand, VMs run full operating
systems. This leads to using more resources.</p>
<h3 id="key-performance-metrics">Key Performance Metrics</h3>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3
id="what-is-the-main-difference-between-docker-and-virtual-machines">1.
What is the main difference between Docker and virtual machines?</h3>
<p>We can say Docker is a tool that helps us package applications and
their needed parts into small containers. Virtual machines (VMs) are
different. They create a whole virtual computer, running different
operating systems on one physical server. Because of this, Docker
containers are usually faster and use less space than VMs. To learn more
about Docker, check out <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-is-docker.html">What is
Docker?</a>.</p>
<h3
id="how-does-docker-improve-resource-utilization-compared-to-virtual-machines">2.
How does Docker improve resource utilization compared to virtual
machines?</h3>
<p>Docker containers use the host operating system’s core. This helps us
use resources better than virtual machines, which need a whole OS for
each one. So, Docker gives us less waste, faster setups, and better
growth. By using many containers on one host, we can save a lot on
infrastructure costs.</p>
<h3
id="can-docker-be-used-for-production-environments-like-virtual-machines">3.
Can Docker be used for production environments like virtual
machines?</h3>
<p>Yes, we can use Docker in production, just like VMs. But we should
know the differences in safety and separation. Docker gives us light
application isolation, but VMs provide better separation by using
hardware. For more info on Docker containers, visit <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-docker-containers.html">What

<h3
id="what-are-docker-images-and-how-do-they-differ-from-virtual-machine-images">4.
What are Docker images and how do they differ from virtual machine
images?</h3>
<p>Docker images are templates that we can use to create Docker
containers. They have everything needed to run an application. On the
other hand, virtual machine images include a full operating system and
applications. This makes Docker images much smaller and quicker to
download than VM images. This helps us deploy faster. Learn more about
Docker images by reading <a
href="https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-are-docker-images.html">What
are Docker Images?</a>.</p>
<h3
id="are-there-any-performance-benchmarks-comparing-docker-and-virtual-machines">5.
Are there any performance benchmarks comparing Docker and virtual
machines?</h3>
<p>Yes, benchmarks show that Docker containers start faster and work
better for microservices and stateless applications than VMs. Because
Docker is light, it helps us run applications more efficiently. This
makes it a good choice for developers who want to boost application
performance and manage resources well.</p>
