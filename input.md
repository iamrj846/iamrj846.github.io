## [Array] Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits - Easy

### Understanding the Problem Statement for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number

We need to find the smallest sum of two four-digit numbers. We can make these numbers by splitting the digits from a given array of integers. Each integer in the array is one digit, and the array must have exactly four digits.

To get the minimum sum, we should arrange the digits in the best way. The main steps are:

1. Sort the digits from smallest to biggest.
2. Split the sorted digits into two groups.
3. Make two numbers from these groups.
4. Add the two numbers together.

For example, for the digits [1, 2, 3, 4], the best split gives us the numbers 13 and 24. This results in a minimum sum of 37.

### Analyzing the Constraints and Edge Cases

- **Constraints:**
  - The input array must have exactly four digits (0-9).
  - We can have leading zeros in the numbers (like 02 is okay).
  
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If all digits are the same (like [1, 1, 1, 1]), we get the sum of two same numbers.
  - If there is a zero among the digits (like [0, 1, 2, 3]), we need to handle this to avoid leading zeros.

### Optimal Approach to Solve Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number

To solve the problem in the best way, we follow these steps:

1. **Sort** the array of digits.
2. Split the sorted array into two numbers:
   - The first number uses the first and third digits.
   - The second number uses the second and fourth digits.
3. Add the two numbers together.

Here’s how we can write it in pseudo-code:

```pseudo
function minSum(arr):
    sort(arr)
    num1 = arr[0] * 10 + arr[2]  // First number from first and third digits
    num2 = arr[1] * 10 + arr[3]  // Second number from second and fourth digits
    return num1 + num2
```

### Java Implementation of Minimum Sum Calculation

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinSum {
    public static int minSum(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int num1 = arr[0] * 10 + arr[2];
        int num2 = arr[1] * 10 + arr[3];
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] digits = {3, 5, 1, 4};
        System.out.println("Minimum Sum: " + minSum(digits));
    }
}
```

### Python Implementation for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number

```python
def min_sum(arr):
    arr.sort()
    num1 = arr[0] * 10 + arr[2]
    num2 = arr[1] * 10 + arr[3]
    return num1 + num2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    digits = [3, 5, 1, 4]
    print("Minimum Sum:", min_sum(digits))
```

### C++ Code Solution for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int minSum(vector<int>& arr) {
    sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    int num1 = arr[0] * 10 + arr[2];
    int num2 = arr[1] * 10 + arr[3];
    return num1 + num2;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> digits = {3, 5, 1, 4};
    cout << "Minimum Sum: " << minSum(digits) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Complexity Analysis of Different Approaches

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) because we sort the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) if we sort in place. O(n) if we use a new array.

### Testing and Validation of the Solution

We can test with different digit combinations to check if the function finds the minimum sum correctly. Here are some examples:

- Input: [6, 2, 5, 3] → Output: 58
- Input: [0, 1, 2, 3] → Output: 3

### Frequently Asked Questions

- **Q: Can the input array have non-digit values?**
  - A: No, the input must only have digits from 0 to 9.

- **Q: How does the algorithm deal with leading zeros?**
  - A: The algorithm handles leading zeros correctly when making the numbers.

## Analyzing the Constraints and Edge Cases

When we try to find the minimum sum of a four-digit number by splitting its digits, we need to look at the rules and special cases. Here are the main points to think about:

- **Input Range**: The input must be a four-digit number. This means it should be between 1000 and 9999. We must deal with any numbers that are not in this range.
- **Digit Splitting**: We need to get the digits from the number correctly. For example, if the number is 2023, the digits should be [2, 0, 2, 3].
- **Handling Leading Zeros**: When we make new numbers from the split digits, we need to remember about leading zeros. For example, if we have digits [0, 2], they should make the number 2, not 02.
- **Minimizing the Sum**: Our goal is to make the smallest sum of two two-digit numbers from the original digits. We should find the best way to arrange them. For example, from digits [1, 2, 3, 4], the best split is 12 + 34 = 46. This is smaller than any other way to combine them.
- **Duplicates**: If the input number has the same digits, like 1122, we must make sure we find the right minimum sum without missing any combinations.
- **Negative Inputs**: We should not accept negative numbers. If the input is negative, we should return an error since we only want four-digit positive numbers.

By looking at these rules and special cases carefully, we can make sure our solution works well. This will also help us check the results when we test different situations.

## [Array] Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits - Easy

### Understanding the Problem Statement for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
We want to make the sum of two two-digit numbers as small as possible. To do this, we take a four-digit number and split its digits. Then we rearrange the digits to create two two-digit numbers. Finally, we calculate the sum of these two numbers.

### Analyzing the Constraints and Edge Cases
- The input must be a four-digit number. This means it must be from 1000 to 9999.
- We should think about cases where some digits repeat.
- We need to find the minimum sum when we rearrange the digits.

### Optimal Approach to Solve Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
1. **Extract Digits**: We will change the four-digit number into an array of its digits.
2. **Sort Digits**: We will put the digits in order from smallest to largest.
3. **Form Two-Digit Numbers**: We will take the smallest and the second smallest digits to make the first two-digit number. Then we take the third and the fourth smallest digits for the second two-digit number.
4. **Calculate the Sum**: We will add the two two-digit numbers together.

#### Pseudocode:
```
function minimumSum(num):
    digits = extractDigits(num)
    sort(digits)
    firstNumber = digits[0] * 10 + digits[2]
    secondNumber = digits[1] * 10 + digits[3]
    return firstNumber + secondNumber
```

### Java Implementation of Minimum Sum Calculation
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumSum {
    public static int minimumSum(int num) {
        int[] digits = new int[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            digits[i] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        Arrays.sort(digits);
        return (digits[0] * 10 + digits[2]) + (digits[1] * 10 + digits[3]);
    }
}
```

### Python Implementation for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
```python
def minimum_sum(num):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
    digits.sort()
    return (digits[0] * 10 + digits[2]) + (digits[1] * 10 + digits[3])
```

### C++ Code Solution for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSum(int num) {
        std::vector<int> digits(4);
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            digits[i] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        std::sort(digits.begin(), digits.end());
        return (digits[0] * 10 + digits[2]) + (digits[1] * 10 + digits[3]);
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis of Different Approaches
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) for getting digits, O(n log n) for sorting (where n = 4), so we can say it is O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we use a fixed-size array for digits.

### Testing and Validation of the Solution
We should test our code with different four-digit numbers. We can include edge cases like:
- 1000 (expected result: 1 + 0 = 1)
- 2222 (expected result: 22 + 22 = 44)
- 4321 (expected result: 13 + 42 = 55)

### Frequently Asked Questions
- **Q: Can the input number have leading zeros?**
  - A: No, the input always must be a four-digit number from 1000 to 9999.
- **Q: What if some digits are the same?**
  - A: The method works well with repeated digits because it sorts them and makes the smallest sum.

## [Array] Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits - Easy

### Java Implementation of Minimum Sum Calculation

We can calculate the minimum sum of a four-digit number after splitting its digits. Here is how we do it in Java:

1. First we convert the number to a string. This helps us access its digits easily.
2. Next we store the digits in an array.
3. Then we sort the array. This arranges the digits in order from smallest to biggest.
4. Finally we form two two-digit numbers from the sorted digits and find their sum.

Here is a simple Java code example:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumSum {
    public static int minimumSum(int num) {
        // Convert the number to a character array
        char[] digits = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();

        // Sort the digits
        Arrays.sort(digits);

        // Form two two-digit numbers
        int firstNumber = (digits[0] - '0') * 10 + (digits[2] - '0');
        int secondNumber = (digits[1] - '0') * 10 + (digits[3] - '0');

        // Return the minimum sum
        return firstNumber + secondNumber;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 2736;
        System.out.println("Minimum Sum: " + minimumSum(num)); // Output: 52
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We convert the input number to a character array. This makes it easy to access each digit.
- We use `Arrays.sort()` to sort the digits in order from smallest to biggest.
- We create two two-digit numbers from the sorted digits. This helps to get the minimum sum.
- We return the sum of these two numbers.

This Java code works well to find the minimum sum of a four-digit number after splitting its digits.

## [Array] Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits - Easy

### Python Implementation for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number

To find the minimum sum of a four-digit number after we split its digits, we can follow these steps:

1. **Get the digits** of the four-digit number.
2. **Put the digits in order** from smallest to largest.
3. **Make two two-digit numbers** using the smallest digits to get the lowest sum.
4. **Add these two two-digit numbers** together.

Here is the Python code for this:

```python
def minimum_sum(num):
    # Step 1: Get digits
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
    
    # Step 2: Put the digits in order
    digits.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Make two two-digit numbers
    num1 = digits[0] * 10 + digits[2]  # First two smallest digits
    num2 = digits[1] * 10 + digits[3]  # Last two smallest digits
    
    # Step 4: Add the minimum sum
    return num1 + num2

# Example usage
result = minimum_sum(2736)
print(result)  # Output: 52
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- The function `minimum_sum` takes a four-digit number as input.
- We get the digits and turn them into a list of numbers.
- Then we put this list in order from smallest to biggest.
- We make two two-digit numbers by taking the first two and the last two digits.
- In the end, we return the sum of these two numbers.

This method helps us to find the smallest possible sum of the two numbers made after we split the digits of the four-digit number.

    // Form two numbers from the sorted digits
    int num1 = digits[0] * 10 + digits[2];
    int num2 = digits[1] * 10 + digits[3];

    // Return the minimum sum
    return num1 + num2;
}

int main() {
    int num = 2736; // Example input
    std::cout << "Minimum sum of four digit number: " << minimumSum(num) << std::endl; // Output: 57
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Digit Extraction**: The code takes digits from the number using modulus and integer division.
- **Sorting**: We use the `std::sort` function to put the digits in order for best arrangement.

## [Array] Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits - Easy

### Understanding the Problem Statement for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
We need to find two two-digit numbers from the digits of a four-digit number. Our goal is to make their sum as small as possible. We will treat the four-digit number like an array of digits. By pairing the digits wisely, we can get the minimum sum.

### Analyzing the Constraints and Edge Cases
- The input number must be a four-digit integer (1000 to 9999).
- Each digit can be from 0 to 9.
- We can have leading zeros in two-digit numbers, like 01 or 02.
- Edge cases can be numbers with repeated digits or all digits the same.

### Optimal Approach to Solve Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
1. We convert the four-digit number into an array of its digits.
2. We sort the array to group the smallest digits together.
3. We make two two-digit numbers from the sorted digits by pairing them well.
4. We calculate the sum of these two numbers.

### Java Implementation of Minimum Sum Calculation
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumSum {
    public static int minimumSum(int num) {
        int[] digits = new int[4];
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            digits[i] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        Arrays.sort(digits);
        int num1 = digits[0] * 10 + digits[2];
        int num2 = digits[1] * 10 + digits[3];
        return num1 + num2;
    }
}
```

### Python Implementation for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
```python
def minimum_sum(num):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
    digits.sort()
    num1 = digits[0] * 10 + digits[2]
    num2 = digits[1] * 10 + digits[3]
    return num1 + num2
```

### C++ Code Solution for Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int minimumSum(int num) {
        std::vector<int> digits;
        while (num > 0) {
            digits.push_back(num % 10);
            num /= 10;
        }
        std::sort(digits.begin(), digits.end());
        int num1 = digits[0] * 10 + digits[2];
        int num2 = digits[1] * 10 + digits[3];
        return num1 + num2;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis of Different Approaches
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n). Here n is the number of digits which is fixed at 4. So it is like O(1). Sorting is the main part of the time cost.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for saving the digits. Since n is fixed, it is also O(1) for practical use.

### Testing and Validation of the Solution
We should test with many four-digit integers to check if it works. Some examples are:
- Input: 2736, Output: 57 (27 + 36)
- Input: 4422, Output: 58 (42 + 42)

### Frequently Asked Questions
1. **What if the input is not a four-digit number?**
   The problem says that the input must be a valid four-digit integer.
2. **Can the digits be negative?**
   No, the digits cannot be negative because they are decimal digits.

## [Array] Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits - Easy

### Testing and Validation of the Solution

We need to check if our solution for finding the minimum sum of a four-digit number after splitting its digits is correct. We should do a lot of tests and make sure our solution works in different cases. This includes both edge cases and normal cases.

#### Test Cases

1. **Basic Test Case**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Expected Output: `37` (Numbers formed: 12 and 34)

2. **Edge Case with Zeros**
   - Input: `[0, 0, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `2` (Numbers formed: 01 and 02)

3. **All Digits Same**
   - Input: `[5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - Expected Output: `55` (Numbers formed: 55 and 55)

4. **Descending Order**
   - Input: `[9, 8, 7, 6]`
   - Expected Output: `168` (Numbers formed: 67 and 89)

5. **Random Digits**
   - Input: `[3, 6, 2, 8]`
   - Expected Output: `58` (Numbers formed: 28 and 36)

#### Validation Steps

- We should write unit tests for each test case using a testing framework like JUnit for Java or unittest for Python.
- We will use assertions to check if our output matches the expected output.

#### Example Implementation for Testing in Python

```python
def test_minimum_sum():
    test_cases = [
        ([1, 2, 3, 4], 37),
        ([0, 0, 1, 2], 2),
        ([5, 5, 5, 5], 55),
        ([9, 8, 7, 6], 168),
        ([3, 6, 2, 8], 58)
    ]
    
    for digits, expected in test_cases:
        result = minimum_sum(digits)
        assert result == expected, f"Test failed for {digits}: expected {expected}, got {result}"

test_minimum_sum()
```

#### Java Testing Example

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class MinimumSumTest {

    @Test
    public void testMinimumSum() {
        assertEquals(37, MinimumSum.minimumSum(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4}));
        assertEquals(2, MinimumSum.minimumSum(new int[]{0, 0, 1, 2}));
        assertEquals(55, MinimumSum.minimumSum(new int[]{5, 5, 5, 5}));
        assertEquals(168, MinimumSum.minimumSum(new int[]{9, 8, 7, 6}));
        assertEquals(58, MinimumSum.minimumSum(new int[]{3, 6, 2, 8}));
    }
}
```

#### C++ Testing Example

```cpp
#include <cassert>
#include <vector>

void testMinimumSum() {
    assert(minimumSum({1, 2, 3, 4}) == 37);
    assert(minimumSum({0, 0, 1, 2}) == 2);
    assert(minimumSum({5, 5, 5, 5}) == 55);
    assert(minimumSum({9, 8, 7, 6}) == 168);
    assert(minimumSum({3, 6, 2, 8}) == 58);
}

int main() {
    testMinimumSum();
    return 0;
}
```

By using these methods for testing, we can check our solution very well. This helps to make sure it meets the problem needs for finding the minimum sum of four-digit numbers after splitting the digits.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is the minimum sum of a four-digit number after splitting its digits?
The minimum sum of a four-digit number after we split its digits means we rearrange the digits to make two two-digit numbers. We want to add these numbers to get the smallest sum. To do this, we sort the digits in order from smallest to biggest and pair them in a smart way. For more details, look at our article on [Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits](#).

### 2. How do you implement the minimum sum calculation in Java?
To do the minimum sum calculation in Java, we first get the digits from the four-digit number. Then we sort them and pair them to create two two-digit numbers. Finally, we add these two numbers to find the minimum sum. For an example and more code, see our Java Implementation section in the article.

### 3. Is there a Python solution for calculating the minimum sum of a four-digit number?
Yes, there is a Python solution to find the minimum sum of a four-digit number. The method changes the number into a list of digits. We sort the digits, pair them, and then add the two two-digit numbers we get. You can see the full Python code in our article on [Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits](#).

### 4. What are the time and space complexity considerations for the minimum sum calculation?
The time complexity for finding the minimum sum of a four-digit number after we split its digits is mainly O(n log n) because of sorting. Here, n is the number of digits. The space complexity is O(n) for keeping the digits, which is easy to manage for a four-digit number. For more details, check the Complexity Analysis section in our article.

### 5. Can this problem be solved using C++?
Yes! We can solve this problem using C++. The steps are the same: we take the digits, sort them, and then find the sum of the two two-digit numbers we create. For more detailed C++ code, please see our C++ Implementation section in the article on the [Minimum Sum of Four Digit Number After Splitting Digits](#).

By answering these frequently asked questions, we try to make it clear how to calculate the minimum sum of four-digit numbers. We also show how to do this in different programming languages.
