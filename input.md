Monitoring Docker containers is very important for keeping our applications working well. When we use Prometheus and Grafana, we can collect data, see it clearly, and understand how our Docker containers are doing. Prometheus helps us monitor and send alerts. Grafana gives us a simple dashboard to show the data we collect. This helps us keep an eye on how our containers perform.

In this article, we will show how to monitor Docker containers with Prometheus and Grafana. We will talk about what we need to set up monitoring. We will also explain how to configure Prometheus for Docker monitoring. Then we will see how to visualize Docker metrics with Grafana. We will look at how to gather Docker metrics using cAdvisor. Lastly, we will share some helpful Grafana dashboards made for Docker monitoring. We will also answer some common questions to help you understand the monitoring process better.

## What Are the Prerequisites for Monitoring Docker Containers?

To monitor Docker containers with Prometheus and Grafana, we need to meet some basic requirements. Here is a simple list of what we need:

1. **Docker Installation**: First, we need to install Docker on our host machine. Make sure Docker is running. We can follow the guide on [how to install Docker on different operating systems](https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-install-docker-on-different-operating-systems.html).

2. **Prometheus**: Next, we should install Prometheus. It helps us scrape and store metrics from our Docker containers. We can download it from [Prometheus's official site](https://prometheus.io/download/).

3. **Grafana**: Then, we need to install Grafana. It helps us see the metrics that Prometheus collects. We can get Grafana from [Grafana's official site](https://grafana.com/get).

4. **cAdvisor**: We also need to deploy cAdvisor. It collects metrics from the containers. cAdvisor shows us how much resources the containers use and their performance. We can run it as a Docker container like this:

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name=cadvisor \
     --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
     --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
     --volume=/var/lib/docker:/var/lib/docker:ro \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     google/cadvisor:latest
   ```

5. **Network Configuration**: We must check the network settings. Prometheus needs to access the metrics from cAdvisor. By default, cAdvisor shows metrics on port 8080.

6. **Prometheus Configuration**: We need to create a `prometheus.yml` file. This file helps Prometheus know where to scrape metrics from cAdvisor:

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'cadvisor'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['<YOUR_CADVISOR_IP>:8080']
   ```

7. **Grafana Datasource Configuration**: Finally, we need to add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana. Here are the settings we should use:
   - URL: `http://<YOUR_PROMETHEUS_IP>:9090`
   - Access: Server (default)

When we set up and configure these components correctly, we can monitor our Docker containers using Prometheus and Grafana.

## How to Set Up Prometheus for Docker Monitoring?

To set up Prometheus for Docker monitoring, we can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Docker Network** (this is optional but helps with isolation):
   ```bash
   docker network create monitoring
   ```

2. **Run Prometheus**:
   First, we need to make a `prometheus.yml` configuration file. Here is what we should put in it:

   ```yaml
   global:
     scrape_interval: 15s

   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'docker'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['cadvisor:8080']
   ```

   Now, we can run the Prometheus container with this command:

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name=prometheus \
     --network=monitoring \
     -p 9090:9090 \
     -v $(pwd)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
     prom/prometheus
   ```

3. **Run cAdvisor** to collect Docker metrics:
   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name=cadvisor \
     --network=monitoring \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
     --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
     --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
     --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
     google/cadvisor:latest
   ```

4. **Access Prometheus**:
   We should open our web browser and go to `http://localhost:9090`. We will see the Prometheus UI. There we can start to query metrics from Docker containers.

5. **Verify the Setup**:
   We can check if cAdvisor metrics are being scraped. To do this, we run this query in the Prometheus UI:
   ```
   up{job="docker"}
   ```

This setup helps us to monitor Docker containers using Prometheus well. For more info on Docker and how it works, we can look at articles like [What is Docker and Why Should You Use It?](https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/what-is-docker-and-why-should-you-use-it.html) and [How to Install Docker on Different Operating Systems](https://bestonlinetutorial.com/docker/how-to-install-docker-on-different-operating-systems.html).

## How to Configure Grafana for Visualizing Docker Metrics?

We can set up Grafana to see Docker metrics that Prometheus collects. Here are the steps to do it:

1. **Install Grafana:**
   If we don't have Grafana installed, we can run it using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
   ```

2. **Access Grafana:**
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. The default login info is:
   - **Username:** admin
   - **Password:** admin (it will ask you to change it after first login)

3. **Add Prometheus as a Data Source:**
   - Click on the gear icon (⚙️) on the left side to open the Configuration menu.
   - Choose **Data Sources** and click on **Add data source**.
   - Pick **Prometheus** from the list.
   - In the **HTTP** part, set the URL to your Prometheus server, like `http://localhost:9090`.
   - Click on **Save & Test** to check if Grafana can connect to Prometheus.

4. **Create a Dashboard:**
   - Click on the “+” icon in the sidebar and choose **Dashboard**.
   - Click on **Add new panel**.

5. **Add Metrics:**
   - In the new panel, choose **Prometheus** as the data source.
   - In the **Query** section, we can enter a Prometheus query to show Docker metrics. For example:

   ```promql
   rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{image!="",container_name!="POD"}[5m])
   ```

   This query shows how much CPU each container is using.

6. **Configure Visualization:**
   - Choose the kind of visualization we want (like Graph, Gauge, Table) from the choices.
   - Change the settings for the visualization if we need to (like axes, legend, thresholds).

7. **Save the Dashboard:**
   - After we set up the panels and visualizations, click on the **Save dashboard** icon (diskette icon) at the top.
   - Give a name to your dashboard and click **Save**.

8. **Explore Pre-built Dashboards:**
   - Grafana has many ready-made dashboards. We can find them in the **Dashboard** section by clicking on **Import**.
   - We can enter the ID of popular dashboards from Grafana's dashboard repository, like:
     - Docker Monitoring: 893
     - cAdvisor Monitoring: 8935

By following these steps, we can easily set up Grafana to see Docker metrics. This setup helps us watch how our Docker containers perform in real-time. We get useful info about resource use and other important metrics.

## How to Collect Docker Metrics Using cAdvisor?

To monitor Docker containers well, cAdvisor (Container Advisor) is a great tool. It gives us insights into how containers use resources and their performance. Let's see how we can set it up and use it to collect Docker metrics.

### Step 1: Pull the cAdvisor Docker Image

First, we need to pull the cAdvisor image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull google/cadvisor:latest
```

### Step 2: Run cAdvisor Container

Next, we run cAdvisor in a Docker container. We should map the right ports and bind mount the Docker socket. This will let cAdvisor access Docker metrics:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=cadvisor \
  --volume=/:/rootfs:ro \
  --volume=/var/run:/var/run:rw \
  --volume=/sys:/sys:ro \
  --volume=/var/lib/docker/:/var/lib/docker:ro \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  google/cadvisor:latest
```

### Step 3: Access cAdvisor Dashboard

After we start cAdvisor, we can access the dashboard. Just go to `http://<YOUR_HOST_IP>:8080` in any web browser. There, we can see metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, network I/O, and filesystem usage for each running container.

### Step 4: Integrate cAdvisor with Prometheus

To collect metrics from cAdvisor using Prometheus, we need to add cAdvisor as a target in our Prometheus configuration file (`prometheus.yml`):

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'cadvisor'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['<YOUR_HOST_IP>:8080']
```

### Step 5: Restart Prometheus

After we update the configuration, we should restart our Prometheus server to make changes apply:

```bash
docker restart <prometheus_container_name>
```

### Step 6: Visualize Metrics in Grafana

Once Prometheus is collecting metrics from cAdvisor, we can see these metrics in Grafana. We need to add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana and create dashboards with the metrics we got from cAdvisor.

By doing these steps, we can collect and see Docker metrics using cAdvisor, Prometheus, and Grafana. This helps us monitor our containers better.
